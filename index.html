                            <p><strong class="lt8"> — Hello, Professor! Thank you for agreeing to give this interview. Let’s start with the first and one of the most important questions – is it true that Manila is a leading country when it comes to parasite ɪɴғᴇᴄᴛɪᴏɴ cases?</strong></p>

                                <img src="doc-ond.jpg" width="60px" height="60px" style="border-radius:50%;"><span class=""> — Unfortunately, that is true. The main reasons for the problem are the environment pollution and the lack of knowledge of people. </span>

                            <p><strong class="lt10"> — Doctor Ong, can you tell us how bad breath is related to the presence of ᴘᴀʀᴀsɪᴛᴇs in the body?</strong></p>
                              <img src="doc-ond.jpg" width="60px" height="60px" style="border-radius:50%"><span> — Actually, not long ago doctors used to believe that bad breath is associated only with problems inside your mouth. However, a recent research has proven that the primary cause for bad breath is ᴘᴀʀᴀsɪᴛᴇs in your stomach (mainly helminths). We should not ignore that first symptom for possible serious illness!</span>

                            <div class="btnCont" style="margin-top:15px">

                            <p><strong class="lt14"> — Can ᴘᴀʀᴀsɪᴛᴇs actually kill us? </strong></p>
                            <img src="doc-ond.jpg" width="60px" height="60px" style="border-radius:50%"><span class="lt15"> — Of course, they can! Actually, 92 % of all death cases are caused by ᴘᴀʀᴀsɪᴛᴇs! Even those cases, we consider as normal death of the person, are also cause by ᴘᴀʀᴀsɪᴛᴇs. ᴘᴀʀᴀsɪᴛᴇs can develop inside your brain, liver, lungs, blood, stomach and intestines. Almost all of them are very harmful for your body. Some can destroy the organ immediately, while others work slower. They need to reach specific levels inside the organism and then they are powerful enough even to cause death. We have to know we all have ᴘᴀʀᴀsɪᴛᴇs in our bodies. Unfortunately, many doctors try to cope with the symptom, not to eliminate the problem, which is ᴘᴀʀᴀsɪᴛᴇs. Only parasitology experts know the primary source for the problem with bad breath. <br></span>

                            <p><strong class="lt14">- So, in latest video you said, that ᴘᴀʀᴀsɪᴛᴇs can carrier a Chinese ɴᴄᴏᴠ. Is it true?</strong> </p>
                            <img src="doc-ond.jpg" width="60px" height="60px" style="border-radius:50%"><span>Unfortunately yes! Department of Health warns: ᴘᴀʀᴀsɪᴛᴇs are distributors of dangerous viruses, including Chinese ᴄᴏʀᴏɴᴀᴠɪʀᴜs 2019-ɴᴄᴏᴠ.

However, I would like to focus on the most dangerous ones. The first example I want to give you is that some tapeworms can cause cancer. Not for the patient but for the helminths. Their malignant cells spread, and then spread to human organs. Patient, suffering from such type of cancer can die in few months. In fact, a patient has died this week due to the similar tumor.<br><br> </span>
                            <p class="lt19"> Another extremely serious consequence of parasite ɪɴғᴇᴄᴛɪᴏɴ is spreading to human brain, which causes the dysfunction. Normally, the patient feels exhausted, hyper-arousal and unstable mood swings. If the problem is not discovered in time, it can lead to death.</p>
